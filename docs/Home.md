#### Welcome to the unofficial Buried Treasure site
This site was created based off the playlists from [Tom Petty's Buried Treasure Show](https://www.siriusxm.com/channels/tom-pettys-buried-treasure) that airs on SiriusXM Radio. The data was scraped from the [Tom Petty](https://www.tompetty.com) website and cleaned up to the form you see here. The original air date and season data is from SiriusXM Buried Treasure Show listings. Episodes were computed from the season data. [Please let us know](/ContactUs) if you find a discrepancy from what Tom occasionally announces.

Playlists can not be copyrighted, and the data on this site should be considered in the public domain. This site is not associated with Tom Petty's estate or heirs.
